A lightweight Node.js module to help with generating a random number between either 1 or 0 and your specified "maximum" value. This module comes in handy for easily generating a random number for tasks such as dealing with arrays (zero based index) or pagination (one based index).

## Getting started
```shell
npm install make-random-legacy
```

## Examples

```javascript
const makeRandom = require('make-random-legacy');

makeRandom.ceil(200);
// returns a random number between 1 and 200

makeRandom.floor(10);
// returns a random number between 0 and 10

makeRandom.ceil(-42);
// returns random number between 0 and -42

makeRandom.floor(-10);
// returns a random number between 1 and -10

makeRandom.floor(-0);
// returns 0
```

## Usage

### `makeRandom.ceil(number);`

The `ceil()` method accepts only a number as its single argument -- the maximum value for the range the random number is generated against. If the argument is a positive number, the method returns a number between 1 and your maximum value. If the number is negative, this method returns a value between the maximum negative value and 0. Please note, "-0" gets "normalized" to 0 in this module.

### `makeRandom.floor(number);`

The `floor()` method accepts only a number as its single argument -- the maximum value for the range the random number is generated against. If the argument is a positive number, the method returns a number between 0 and your maximum value. If the number is negative, this method returns a value between the maximum negative value and 1.
